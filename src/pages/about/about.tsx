            <p>My name is Elvis Brevi. I am a Fullstack developer. I cherish my family time with my wife and 
            our two daughters. One of my greatest passions is expressing my creativity through programming. 
            Throughout my career, I have worked in almost every technical area of IT: backend, frontend, mobile, 
            games, desktop, cloud, and some devops tasks. I have also programmed in PHP, C#, Visual Basic, 
            Javascript, Typescript, Java, Python... I have extensive knowledge and am now seeking deep expertise 
            with Rust.</p>

            <p>I have created this personal wiki as my "second brain". I often explore technologies or ideas and 
            note them down here as a way to remember and share my learnings and thoughts.</p>
