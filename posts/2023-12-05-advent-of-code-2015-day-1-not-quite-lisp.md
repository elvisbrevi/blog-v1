# Advent of Code 2015, Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

## The Puzzle, Part One:

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect *fifty stars* by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants *one star*. Good luck!

Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

An opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

For example:

* `(())` and `()()` both result in floor `0`.
    
* `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor `3`.
    
* `))(((((` also results in floor `3`.
    
* `())` and `))(` both result in floor `-1` (the first basement level).
    
* `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor `-3`.
    

To *what floor* do the instructions take Santa?

## My Solution

* I create a file [`Input.rs`](http://Input.rs) the module for storing input of puzzles, and read this in `input` variable.
    
* declared a `posible_values` hashmap to determine the value of characters `(` and `)` .
    
* finally, iterate the `input` values, get the value of each character from the hashmap `possible_values`, and add them to the `floor` variable.
    

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
mod input;

fn main() {
    let posible_values = HashMap::from([('(', 1), (')', -1)]);
    let input = input::get_input();
    let mut floor = 0;

    for char in input.chars() {
        if let Some(value) = posible_values.get(&char) {
            floor += value;
        }
    }

    println!("The instructions take Santa to floor {} üè¢", floor);
}
```

`Input.rs` :

```rust
pub fn get_input() -> &'static str {
    "()(((()))(()()()())))))(((()()(((()))(()()()((((()"
}
```

## The Puzzle, Part Two:

Now, given the same instructions, find the *position* of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor `-1`). The first character in the instructions has position `1`, the second character has position `2`, and so on.

For example:

* `)` causes him to enter the basement at character position `1`.
    
* `()())` causes him to enter the basement at character position `5`.
    

What is the *position* of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?

## My Solution

* I declared two new variables:
    
    * a flag `index` to get the position of character in the input iteration.
        
    * and `character_position` variable for storing the `index` value when the `floor` is -1 for the first time.
        

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let posible_values = HashMap::from([('(', 1), (')', -1)]);
    let input = "()(((()))(()()()())))))(((()()(((()))(()()()((((()";
    let mut floor = 0;
    let mut index = 1;
    let mut character_position = 0;

    for char in input.chars() {
        if let Some(value) = posible_values.get(&char) {
            floor += value;
        }

        if character_position == 0 && floor == -1 {
            character_position = index;
        }

        index += 1;
    }

    println!(
        "The position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement is {} üéÖ",
        character_position
    );
    println!("The instructions take Santa to floor {} üè¢", floor);
}
```
